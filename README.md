This is a simple program that tries to find the words for the game rabbel.se

To use it:
Just enter the games characters in the matrix at the top of the code, and run it. It should return a list with all the words.

The file words.py contains a list with the SAOL (Swedish Word List) that I found somewhere on the internet.
